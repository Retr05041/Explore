### TODO:

    - Seperate file for player / DB?
    - Player struct inside DB struct?
    - Lots of error catching for possible wrong inputs... (especially for new player name)
    - Needs a table constructor dependant on metadata
    - current room index option...
    - Save state of player
- Need to implement commands for: needed item, get an item....
    - Need to come up with more ideas for commands...
